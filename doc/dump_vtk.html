      vx,vy,vz = atom velocities
      fx,fy,fz = forces on atoms
      q = atom charge
      mux,muy,muz = orientation of dipole moment of atom
      mu = magnitude of dipole moment of atom
      radius,diameter = radius,diameter of spherical particle
      omegax,omegay,omegaz = angular velocity of extended particle

      f_ID[N] = Nth column of per-atom array calculated by a fix with ID
      v_name = per-atom vector calculated by an atom-style variable with name

<P><B>Example:</B>
</P>
<P>If we assume that fix_multistress has the fix id 1 and compute coord/gran has the compute id 6:
</P>
<PRE>dump 1 all vtk 1000 dump.*.vtp c_1_stress[1] mass id c_6 fx vy x 
</PRE>
<P>will cause one .vtp file to be written every 1000 timesteps. Each will contain the x-component
of mean stress, the mass, the atom id, the number of contacts, the x-component of force and the
y-component of velocity for all particles. Note that x was ignored - this is because it is
written out by default (see below).
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a modification of <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> with the <I>custom</I> style. Instead of
creating conventional dump files, this fix creates .vtp files which are formatted
correctly for input to ParaView. The .vtp files are written every N timesteps and 
only information for atoms in the specified group is dumped.
</P>
<P>You don't need to specify particle coordinates and diameters; these are written
out automatically as ParaView needs them. If you do specify <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I> or <I>diameter</I>
among the list of arguments, they are ignored as they are written at the start of
each .vtp file anyway. Therefore the following two lines do exactly the same thing
if used in a script:
</P>
<PRE>dump 1 all vtk 5 dump.*.vtp y z x diameter
dump 1 all vtk 5 dump.*.vtp 
</PRE>
<P>It is important to put an asterisk into the filename, as dump vtk is supposed to write 
one file per requested timestep. As it would not be useful to write everything to the
same file, an error message is returned if this is attempted (i.e., if the asterisk
is omitted).
</P>
<P>The written .vtp files are sorted by default - this is necessary to guarantee
that some of the data gathered from multiple processors is kept in sync properly.
This is the case even if the <A HREF = "atom_modify.html">atom_modify sort</A> option is off.
</P>

<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-atom vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> to be output. The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script. See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details. Note that computes which
calculate global or local quantities, as opposed to per-atom quantities,
cannot be output in a dump vtk command. 
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the compute is printed. If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the compute.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow vector or array per-atom
quantities calculated by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been
defined previously in the input script.  The <A HREF = "fix_ave_atom.html">fix
ave/atom</A> command is one that calculates per-atom
quantities. Since it can time-average per-atom quantities produced by
any <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A>, <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A>, or atom-style
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>, this allows those time-averaged results to
be written to a dump file.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector calculated
by the fix is printed.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the M-length
per-atom array calculated by the fix.
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> attribute allows per-atom vectors calculated by a
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been
defined previously in the input script.  Only an atom-style variable
can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates per-atom
values.  Variables of style <I>atom</I> can reference individual atom
attributes, per-atom atom attributes, thermodynamic keywords, or
invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so
this is a very general means of creating quantities to output to a
dump file.
