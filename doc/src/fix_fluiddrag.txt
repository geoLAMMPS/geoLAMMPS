fix fluiddrag command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID fluiddrag i N style magnitude args :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
fluiddrag = style name of this fix command :l
i = hydraulic gradient :l
N = {0} or {1} :l
{0} = subtract the velocity of the largest particle from
the velocities of all particles in the system on each timestep
{1} = do not perform this velocity adjustment :pre
magnitude = size of acceleration (force/mass units) :l
style = {chute} or {spherical} or {gradient} or {vector} :l
  {chute} args = angle
    angle = angle in +x away from -z or -y axis in 3d/2d (in degrees)
  {spherical} args = phi theta
    phi = azimuthal angle from +x axis (in degrees)
    theta = angle from +z or +y axis in 3d/2d (in degrees)
  {gradient} args = phi theta phi_grad theta_grad
    phi = azimuthal angle from +x axis (in degrees)
    theta = angle from +z or +y axis in 3d/2d (in degrees)
    phi_grad = rate of change of angle phi (full rotations per time unit)
    theta_grad = rate of change of angle theta (full rotations per time unit)
  {vector} args = x y z
    x y z = vector direction to apply the acceleration :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all fluiddrag 5.0 0 vector 1 0 0 :pre

[Description:]

A fix based on "fix gravity"_fix_gravity.html which simulates the flow
of water through a packing of particles using a simple model. It is
important to note that SI units must be used as the specific weight
of water is hard-coded as 9810 kg/(m2.s2) for convenience.

A per-atom array is created by this fix which contains data about the
simulation which may be of interest. This can be written to a file using the
"dump custom"_dump.html command, for example:

fix		9 all fluiddrag 1.0 1 vector 1 0 0 
dump		1 all custom 5000 dump.drag_forces f_9\[1\] f_9\[2\] f_9\[3\] f_9\[4\] f_9\[5\] f_9\[6\] f_9\[7\] f_9\[8\] f_9\[9\] f_9\[10\] f_9\[11\] :pre

Of course, asterisks can be used to write separate files at each write interval
if so desired. There are 9 available columns in 2D and 11 in 3D which are ordered as follows:

{[2D:]}

 [1] The tag of particle {i} :l
 [2] The x-coordinate of particle {i} :l
 [3] The y-coordinate of particle {i} :l
 [4] The radius of particle {i} :l
 [5] The total volume enclosed by the walls or periodic boundaries :l
 [6] The x-component of the particle-fluid interaction force applied to particle {i} :l
 [7] The y-component of the particle-fluid interaction force :l
 [8] The porosity of the sample :l
 [9] The drag force (based on effective diameter) :l

{[3D:]}

 [1] The tag of particle {i} :l
 [2] The x-coordinate of particle {i} :l
 [3] The y-coordinate of particle {i} :l
 [4] The z-coordinate of particle {i} :l
 [5] The radius of particle {i} :l
 [6] The total volume enclosed by the walls or periodic boundaries :l
 [7] The x-component of the particle-fluid interaction force applied to particle {i} :l
 [8] The y-component of the particle-fluid interaction force :l
 [9] The z-component of the particle-fluid interaction force :l
 [10] The porosity of the sample :l
 [11] The drag force (based on effective diameter) :l

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix. No parameter of this fix can
be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.
The existence of per-atom quantities has already be described.

[Restrictions:]

* Fix fluiddrag requires the use of the sphere atom_style.

* SI units must be used at present.
