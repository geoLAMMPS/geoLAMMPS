<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix allows particle crushing during a simulation. The two-parameter failure 
criterion for brittle materials proposed by Christensen (2000) was chosen, which
is well described by Russell and Muir Wood (2009). In order to use this failure
criterion, two parameters are needed: chi and kappa. The <I>chi</I> parameter (to which
the model is fairly insensitive) is one of the input parameters to this fix. The
kappa parameter may be found using <I>m</I>, <I>sigma0</I>, <I>d0</I>, <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>. Experimental 
values of these parameters for a real sand are given by Nakata et al. (1999).
</P>
<P><I>alpha</I> is a fudge which allows the strengths to be reduced by a specified amount.
This was added because the particles tend to be far too strong (negligible failure
occurring at very high stresses) without this arbitrary reduction of strength. The
reasons for the excessively high strengths are discussed by Hanley et al. (2014). If
you do not wish to use this <I>alpha</I> reduction, set it to 1.0 to disable it.
</P>
<P>There are two available options for the amount to reduce particle diameter
upon failure which can be selected using <I>redtype</I>. If <I>redtype</I> = 1, this means
that particle diameters are reduced upon failure so that they just lose contact 
with all surrounding particles. If <I>redtype</I> = 0, the following argument in
FixCrushing specifies the fraction by which particle diameters are reduced.
</P>
<P>The specification of a comminution limit, <I>commlimit</I>, is optional but highly
recommended. Note that the timestep calculated using <I>'timestep auto'</I> is not
recalculated during a simulation. Therefore, if very small particles are added
to a simulation, stability is no longer assured.
</P>
<P>It is mandatory to specify one set of <I>m</I>, <I>sigma0</I>, <I>d0</I>, <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>. Optionally,
a second set can be specified. If this is done, the first set of parameters is used
to allocate particle strengths before initial failure, while the second set of
parameters is used to allocated particle strengths after the first
failure. The logic is that the first failure might be attributed to asperity
breakage while the second and subsequent failures might be due to gross splitting.
If the second set of parameters is not specified, the first set of parameters is
used in all cases.
</P>
<P>By default, the allocated particle strengths are stored in the restart file and
reallocated to the particles when the simulation is resumed from a restart file.
It may be desired to change the strengths part-way through a simulation, e.g., 
if the Weibull modulus is changed. The <I>reallocate</I> specifier is used to ignore
the strengths in the restart file and reallocate strengths based on the current
FixCrushing arguments.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix writes detailed information about each particle failure to the screen 
if <I>outputflag</I> is set at 1; this detailed output is suppressed if 
<I>outputflag</I> is 0.
</P>
<P>In addition, three per-particle quantities are available to write to dump
files using <A HREF = "dump_custom.html">dump_custom</A>: (1) the uniaxial compressive
strength, (2) the uniaxial tensile strength and (3) the number of failures
experienced by the particle. These can be written to dump files using the 
following syntax:
