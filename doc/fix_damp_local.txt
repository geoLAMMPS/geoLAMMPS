fix damp/local command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID damp/local alpha :pre
  
ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
damp/local = style name of this fix command :l
alpha = local damping coefficient :l

[Examples:]

fix 1 AtomsToDamp damp/local 0.7 :pre

[Description:]

Add a damping force to atoms in the group. This damping force is not 
related to any physically justified damping model, but constitutes a
rather efficient way of bringing the system down to equilibrium.

The damping force F is given by F_i = - alpha * sign(velocity_i) * Fresultant_i

A damping moment M is also added. This is given by M_i = - alpha * sign(omega_i) * Mresultant_i 

[NOTE: there are 3 of these equations, one for each vector component of force/moment and velocity]

The alpha coefficient can only range between 0 and 1 and represents
the proportion of the resultant force/moment (i.e. acceleration) of an atom
that will be removed if Fresultant and velocity are collinear.

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html can be used
to change the alpha parameter.  No global or per-atom quantities
are stored by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.

[Restrictions:] none
